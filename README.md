# Sudoku2GraphColoring reduction
Sudoku solved as a graph-coloring instance: a polynomial reduction, two backtracking algorithms side by side, and an interface that shows both representations — grid and graph — as the same object seen from two angles.

## The reduction
- Each cell `(r, c)` of the 9×9 grid becomes a node → **81 nodes**.
- Two nodes are connected if their cells share a constraint (same row, same column, or same 3×3 block) → **810 edges**, degree 20 per node.
- Cells already filled in become a fixed pre-coloring.
A 9-coloring of the graph that respects the pre-coloring corresponds exactly to a Sudoku solution. Generalized Sudoku is NP-complete (Yato & Seta, 2003); k-coloring is NP-complete for k ≥ 3 — which is why this problem makes a good case study for the course.

## Two algorithms, same problem
 
- **Naive** — row-by-row backtracking, first valid digit, no heuristics.
- **DSATUR + Forward Checking** (Brélaz, 1979) — at each step, colors the node with maximum saturation (MRV: fewer available colors means a tighter constraint, so it fails earlier), and propagates the constraint to direct neighbors immediately after each assignment.
Same worst-case complexity (the problem is still NP-hard), but DSATUR explores a search tree orders of magnitude smaller in practice — the app makes this visible by comparing nodes explored by both algorithms on the same instance.

## Interface
 
- The Sudoku grid and the graph share the same `(r, c)` coordinates: selecting a cell draws its 20 edges in the graph panel, live.
- Puzzle generation by difficulty (easy / medium / hard) or fixed seed, plus an "expert" preset (AI Escargot).
- Step-by-step animated solving, with a run history that accumulates (useful for comparing DSATUR vs naive across several instances) — only cleared by "Clear".
